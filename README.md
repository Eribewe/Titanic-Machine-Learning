## Titanic-Machine-Learning

#### Overview
The data is split into two groups:
##### 1. training set (train.csv)
##### 2. test set (test.csv)

The training set is used to build the machine learning models. For the training set, the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger is available. The model is based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class.

The test set is used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. For the test set, the ground truth for each passenger is not provided. It is what we intend to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

I also include the submission file which contains the predicted outcome for each passenger.
